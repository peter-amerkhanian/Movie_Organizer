#Media Organizer
Find video media files in a messy directory.  
![Excel](http://tinypic.com/r/b5sk8k/9)

## Installation/Usage:
Python 3.6 required. Download the zip file of the repo, open a terminal in that directory.
```
# Install the requirements    
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the python file
$ python movie_scanner.py
```
The program will then prompt you for a Windows absolute path, i.e. 'C:\user\joe\downloads'

## TODO:
* The title recognition in the info_extract function still needs work in order to more effectively deal with oddly named video files.
